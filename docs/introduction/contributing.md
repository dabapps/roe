Fork the repository and run the following to install dependencies:

```shell
npm i
```

To start all the watchers (TypeScript, LESS, markdown files, etc), and serve the documentation with livereloading, run the following:

```shell
npm start
```

Or if you just want play around with some components without updating the documentation, you can run the `/examples` directory with livereloading by running the following:

```shell
npm run budo
```
