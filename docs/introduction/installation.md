Roe can be installed from npm using the following command:

```shell
npm i @dabapps/roe -S
```

Note: `-S` is shorthand for `--save` (to add Roe to your package.json)

If you are using a version of npm that does not support package lock files, it's recommended that you pin Roe to a specific version to avoid breaking changes.

To do so, run the following command:

```shell
npm i @dabapps/roe -SE
```

Note: `-SE` is shorthand for `--save-exact` (which will pin to a specific version of Roe in your package.json)
