### Releases

Roe is currently not at a major release, and therefore changes to the API are expected on a reasonably regular basis. Changes to the minor version number at this stage signify potentially breaking changes, and changes to the patch number will include minor API changes as well as bug fixes.

### Browser support

Although Roe currently works in IE8+ (graceful degradation), support for IE8 (and possibly newer versions) may be dropped completely before the first major release.
